## My Process

### What I learned

Something that I want to highlight, and made me learn a lot, was the style and the use or method of how to use and create color palettes and what elements should have it. I learn a lot from this by doing these challenges, it's not something technical but it makes me a better Front-End Dev. I didn't use JSON because I don't have proper knowledge in JS, but that's what I learned at the time.
